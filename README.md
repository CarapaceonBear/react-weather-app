# react-weather-app

A simple weather app, using APIs.<br>
The app shows weather icons and temperatures for the next 8 hours, in 2 hour increments.<br>
The user is presented with a message, which changes depending on the time. The background also reflects the time.<br>
Another API is used to show the user's general location.<br>

[Github Pages Deployment](https://carapaceonbear.github.io/react-weather-app/)<br>
(The deployed app does not show your location, as the free version of the location API uses http, not https)
